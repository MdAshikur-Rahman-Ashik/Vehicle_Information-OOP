<h2>📂 Project Contents</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Program Class:</strong> <code>Program.cs</code> - Contains the main entry point and the program logic to select and display information about different vehicles.</li>
  <li><strong>Car Class:</strong> <code>Car.cs</code> - Defines properties and behaviors specific to car objects, such as seating capacity and interior design options.</li>
  <li><strong>MotorCycle Class:</strong> <code>MotorCycle.cs</code> - Defines properties and behaviors specific to motorcycle objects, such as engine specifications and exterior design features.</li>
  <li><strong>Vehicle Base Class:</strong> <code>Vehicle.cs</code> - The abstract base class defining common vehicle attributes, which Car and MotorCycle inherit from.</li>
  <li><strong>Enums and Utilities:</strong> Defines enums like <code>VehicleType</code> and helper functions to categorize vehicle data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📝 Project Description</h2>
<p>This project implements a basic vehicle information system with two main vehicle types: <strong>Car</strong> and <strong>MotorCycle</strong>. Each type has unique attributes and methods, following an OOP structure that leverages C#'s class inheritance, method overriding, and data encapsulation.</p>

<h3>🏷️ Classes and Attributes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vehicle (Base Class):</strong> Common attributes include Brand, Model, Year, Engine Capacity, and Gear Type.</li>
  <li><strong>Car:</strong> Adds unique attributes such as Door Count, Seating Capacity, and Interior Design Options.</li>
  <li><strong>MotorCycle:</strong> Adds unique attributes such as Maximum Power, Torque, and Exterior Design Options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 How to Use</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine:</li>
  <pre><code>https://github.com/MdAshikur-Rahman-Ashik/Vehicle_Information-OOP</code></pre>

  <li>Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE of your choice.</li>

  <li>Run the <code>Program.cs</code> file. You will be prompted to choose the type of vehicle and view its information.</li>

  <li>Follow the prompts to view vehicle details, such as brand, model, year, and additional information based on the selected vehicle type.</li>
</ol>

<h2>🌟 Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>🚗 Demonstrates OOP principles with inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</li>
  <li>🏍️ Different classes for <strong>Car</strong> and <strong>MotorCycle</strong>, each with specific properties and methods.</li>
  <li>🔄 Method overriding for customized vehicle display information.</li>
  <li>📑 Enum support for vehicle types, enhancing code readability and maintainability.</li>
</ul>
